Ceph doesn't like IP address changes, and that's what would happen if
we completely built this appliance and then you installed it in your
own hosting environment.  To get around that problem, we've included a
script to finish the configuration, ceph-configure-on-first-boot.sh.
Please run it to configure Ceph.

The included site.pp file configures a Ceph OSD process to use a
dedicated virtual disk at /dev/vdb.  Please ensure that you have a
second disk attached to this virtual machine and update the path if
necessary.
